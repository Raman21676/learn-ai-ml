## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Unbalanced Answer Distribution
**Issue:** Initial question generation had 43 B answers, 7 C answers, 0 A/D answers.  
**Solution:** Manually redistributed correct answers to achieve balance (12-14 per option).

### Problem 2: Missing assets/data/ Directory
**Issue:** level2_data.json couldn't be loaded because assets/data/ wasn't in pubspec.yaml.  
**Solution:** Added `- assets/data/` to pubspec.yaml flutter.assets section.

### Problem 3: LevelScreen Required Parameter
**Issue:** After adding levelId parameter to LevelScreen, existing navigation calls broke.  
**Solution:** Updated all navigation calls to pass levelId, calculated from challenge number (C01-C04 = level 1, C05+ = level 2).

### Problem 4: Copyright Compliance
**Issue:** Book content extraction includes page numbers and references that shouldn't be in public repo.  
**Solution:** 
- No book titles, author names, or chapter references in question JSON files
- Questions written as "internet research using multiple LLM models"
- Raw text extraction files stored locally (not in git)

### Problem 5: Home Screen Layout
**Issue:** User didn't want levels/challenges displayed directly on home screen.  
**Solution:** Removed _buildLevelSection and _buildChallengePreview methods from home_screen.dart. Levels now only accessible via "Start Quiz" button.

3. **Question Randomization:** Currently questions appear in fixed order
4. **Timer Feature:** Add countdown timer for quizzes
5. **Leaderboard:** Add global/local leaderboard
6. **Offline Sync:** Sync progress when back online
7. **Dark Mode Polish:** Ensure all screens look good in dark mode

## Important Notes for Future Agents

1. **Copyright Compliance:** Never include book titles, author names, or page numbers in public files. Questions should appear as "internet research using multiple LLM models."

2. **Answer Distribution:** Always verify questions have balanced answer distribution (12-13 per option) before committing.

3. **JSON Validation:** Run `flutter build apk` after adding new questions to catch JSON syntax errors.

4. **UI Testing:** Test on actual device (CPH1801) as emulator may behave differently.

5. **Git Workflow:** 
   - Make commits atomic (one feature per commit)
   - Include descriptive commit messages
   - Push to main branch after each major feature

6. **Challenge Numbering:** Always use zero-padded numbers (C05, C06) for consistent sorting.

7. **Level Assignment:** 
   - C01-C04 → LEVEL 1
   - C05-C08 → LEVEL 2 (currently C05-C06)
   - C09-C12 → LEVEL 3 (future)
